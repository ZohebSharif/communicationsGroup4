This group project for CS401 (Software Engineering) will demonstrate our understanding of fundamental software engineering concepts by developing a fully functional communications application using exclusively Java. The application sport software components like a backend server, a graphical user interface (GUI), a server, and multiple clients to support real-time messaging. 

The goal of this project is to design and implement a chat application, similar to  Discord. This applicaiton will allow users to log in to their account and send messages to other users asynchronously and synchronously. The application will emphasize core software engineering practices such as object-oriented programming, socket-based networking, and user interface development.

For more information of the requirements and functionality of our project, refer to our Software Requirement Specification Document.
